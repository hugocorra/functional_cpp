Semigroups:
1) sets under the union operation
2) numbers under multiplication
3) strings (or sequences in general) under concatenation

Exercise:
1) Can you find neutral elements to these three semigroups
and thus make them monoids?

{} (empty set),
1 (one)
"" (empty string)


2) Which of them are commutative and which are not?
set is commutative
numbers under multiplication are commutative
strings are no commutative
